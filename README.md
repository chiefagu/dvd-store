  DVD Rental Store
</h1>

ðŸ‘‹ hi there! My name is [Josh](https://github.com/chiefagu)! This is a
repo for a fictional movie rental store

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v12 or greater
- [yarn][yarn] v1 or greater (or [npm][npm] v6 or greater)

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
yarn --version # or npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup
After you've made sure to have the correct versions installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
npm install
npm run validate
```

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in watch mode. Read the output and
play around with it.
